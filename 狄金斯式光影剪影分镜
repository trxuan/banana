# 狄金斯式光影剪影分镜
**[Type]:** A cinematic storyboard grid emphasizing extreme contrast lighting (Chiaroscuro). **Minimalist composition, bold silhouettes, vast negative space.**
**[Layout Design]:** A 3x3 grid. The composition alternates between stark black shadows and bright light sources.

**[Subject Consistency - STRICT]:**
* **Source:** Based strictly on the uploaded reference image. **[SAME CHARACTER IN ALL PANELS]**.
* **Visibility:** The character is mostly seen in silhouette or rim-lighting. Their identity is defined by outline and posture rather than facial detail.
* **Action:** Static, contemplative poses. Standing still, looking down, or slowly walking.

**[Lighting & Composition Guide - "The Architecture of Light"]:**

**Row 1: The Void (Negative Space)**
1. **Top-Left:** Extreme Long Shot. Tiny silhouette of the subject standing in a vast desert or empty concrete hall. 90% of frame is empty sky/wall.
2. **Top-Middle:** Medium Shot Silhouette. Subject stands in front of a massive, bright circular light source (like a setting sun or tunnel opening). Rim light only.
3. **Top-Right:** High angle looking down. Subject's long shadow stretches across the floor.

**Row 2: The Texture (Light forming Shape)**
4. **Center-Left:** "Venetian Blind" effect. Strips of hard light cut across the subject's face in a dark room.
5. **Center (Focus):** Profile shot. A single harsh rim light outlines the edge of their face and hair against pure blackness.
6. **Center-Right:** Silhouette against smoke/fog that is back-lit by an orange or blue light source.

**Row 3: The Environment (Man vs. World)**
7. **Bottom-Left:** Wide shot of a brutalist building. Subject is a small dark speck against a massive illuminated concrete wall.
8. **Bottom-Middle:** Subject walking through a dark corridor towards a blinding light at the end.
9. **Bottom-Right:** Reflection of the silhouette in a puddle of water on dark asphalt.

**[Aesthetic Style]:**
* **Color Palette:** Monochromatic or duo-tone (e.g., Deep Orange/Black, Cold Blue/Black).
* **Mood:** Isolation, atmospheric, epic, quiet tension.
