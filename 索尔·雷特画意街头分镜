# 索尔·雷特画意街头分镜
**[Type]:** An artistic, painterly contact sheet mimicking Saul Leiter's street photography. **Obscured views, layers, reflections, and bold color blocking.**
**[Vibe]:** Impressionistic, private, rainy day melancholy, visually complex.

**[Subject Consistency - STRICT]:**
* **Source:** Based strictly on the uploaded reference image. **[SAME CHARACTER IN ALL PANELS]**.
* **Visibility:** The subject is rarely seen clearly. They are viewed *through* something or partially blocked.
* **Setting:** Urban street, cafe interior, rainy city.

**[Compositional Layers - "Seeing Through"]:**

**The "Steamed Glass" Layer:**
* **Panels 1, 5, 9:** Shot through a window covered in heavy condensation or rain streaks. The subject inside is blurred, a wash of color and shape. Outside city lights smear into bokeh.

**The "Reflection" Layer:**
* **Panels 3, 7:** Shot looking into a shop window or mirror. The subject's reflection is mixed overlapping with the street scene behind the camera. Double exposure effect.

**The "Foreground Block" Layer:**
* **Panel 2:** A large red umbrella occupies the left half of the frame. Subject is visible on the right, out of focus.
* **Panel 4:** View through a narrow gap in curtains or a partially open door. Subject is sliver of view.
* **Panel 6:** A blurred taxi roof or passerby's shoulder blocks the bottom half of the shot.

**The "Color Field" Layer:**
* **Panel 8:** Focus on texture. A wet pavement reflecting neon signs, with the subject's blurry feet walking through it.

**[Aesthetic Style]:**
* **Film Stock:** Kodachrome grain. Rich, deep, saturated colors (especially reds, greens, yellows). Soft focus. painterly brush-stroke feel.
